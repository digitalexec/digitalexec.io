It seems obvious: Technology should serve people- especially during crisis. But that's not always the case. The **speed** at which an organization deploys technology to **solve problems** depends on its **mission and culture**. This week, my colleagues and I built an online donation form and updated our website's home page to collect relief funds for victims of Hurricane Dorian in the Bahamas and along the U.S. east coast. It was the first time in our nonprofit organization's 10-year history that we leveraged the **power of the Internet** to raise money for people harmed by a natural disaster. The impact was immediate: In **less than 24 hours**, our digital effort netted scores of donors who collectively gave **thousands of dollars** to ease suffering and aid reconstruction in the Bahamas and elsewhere. Our organization's partners shared our **social media posts** and **donation-page url** with their followers. The Central Florida community responded by commenting on our **humanitarian relief** effort and sharing the donation-information with their **network of family and friends**.

**Lessons learned:**<br>
* We created a broadly defined "Disaster Collection" web page that will stay on our website for the entire Hurricane season, rather than a Hurricane Dorian-specific web page that would disappear when the storm does. (The Atlantic hurricane season runs from June 1st to November 30th).<br>
* We will prepare hurricane related digital-media assets in advance (photos, graphics, web pages, etc) so they are ready for website deployment before the next storm arrives.<br>
* We will add a "Disaster Collection" website navigation option to make it easier for people to give throughout the Hurricane season and during future times of crisis.<br>

**Leadership Lesson:**<br>
While the future is uncertain, organizations in Hurricane-prone zones can serve their communities by preparing robust communications plans in advance.

**Sample website ideas that industries can use during a hurricane:**<br>
* Health systems can list emergency-room wait times by hospital.<br>
* Local Governments can list shelters that accept people and pets (a major issue for pet owners).<br>
* Schools and Airports can report when they will re-open via text message, websites and social media.<br>
