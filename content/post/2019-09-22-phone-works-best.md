Sometimes, it takes a phone call.<br><br>
Sure, digital- and social-media channels are a powerful way to reach millions of people in a flash. But sometimes they are not the best tools for the job.<br><br>
Indeed, when our nonprofit organization recently launched the first phase of our marketing-and-communication strategy to promote our first-ever investor seminar, the results were lukewarm. Part of the challenge was that our constituents were not familiar with this type of seminar offering from us. But there were other challenges, as well. Just because digital messages can be instantaneously blasted to tens of thousands of people does not necessarily mean they understand the benefits of what you are offering. <br><br>
**The solution:** Staff followed up with a series of phone calls to answer questions, discuss the seminar's benefits, and personally invite key constituents.<br><br>
**The result?** The phone calls humanized our organization's communications outreach, helped us to better understand our clients' needs, which helped us to gain a healthy audience for our investor seminar.<br><br>
**Learning from our experience:**<br>
- For our next high-profile investing seminar, we decided to integrate personal phone-call invitations into our communications matrix, rather than using phone calls as a last minute add-on strategy. <br>
- Based on survey feedback from our previous seminar, we updated our communications messaging for the next seminar.<br><br>
**General Lesson:**<br>
- Communicating via the web and social media is powerful. But the mediums are useless if your messaging is out-of-sync with your target audience, or built on faulty assumptions.<br><br>
**Leadership Lessons:**<br>
- In today's world, leaders need to know how to craft nimble strategies that blend the web, social media, video, face-to-face marketing, print media and, sometimes, phone calls.<br>
- Leaders must remain fluid and adjust strategies on-the-fly based on the evidence of data and customer feedback.<br><br>
  **Ideas for other industries:**<br>
	- **Health Care and Finance:** Given the private nature of these industries, clients will often require the human outreach of a personal meeting or call. For sensitive issues, digital- and social-media outreach alone is typically not enough. While this makes sense on face value, it requires an organization to reserve staff time and resources to personalize outreach.
